but His Majesty has con- \n tinued to afford to the Queen of Spain that aid \n which, by the Treaty of Quadruple Alliance of \n 1834, His Majesty engaged to give, if it should \n become necessary ; and His Majesty rejoices that \n A. 1837. \n His co-operating force has rendered useful assistance \n to the troops of her Catholic Majesty. \n Events have happened in Portugal, which for a \n time threatened to disturb the internal peace of that \n country. \n His Majesty ordered, in consequence, a \n temporary augmentation of His Naval force in the \n Tagus, for the more effectual protection of the per- \n sons and property of His subjects resident in Lis- \n bon; and the Admiral commanding His Majesty's \n squadron was authorized, in case of need, to afford \n protection to the person of the Queen of Portugal, \n without, however, interfering in those constitutional \n questions which divided the conflicting parties. \n His Majesty has directed the Reports of the Com- \n missioners appointed to inquire into the state of the \n Province of Lower Canada to be laid before you, \n and has ordered us to call your attention to that \n important subject. \n We have it also in charge to recommend for your \n serious deliberation those provisions which will be \n submitted to you for the improvement of the Law, \n and of the administration of Justice ; assuring you \n that His Majesty's anxiety for the accomplishment \n of these objects remains undiminished. \n We are enjoined to convey to you His Majesty's \n desire that you should consult upon such further \n measures as may give increased stability to the Esta- \n blished Church, and promote concord and good- \n will. \n Gentlemen of the House of Commons, \n The Estimates of the year have been prepared \n with every desire to meet the exigencies of the Public \n Service in the spirit of a wise economy. \n His Ma- \n j esty has directed them to be laid before you without \n delay. \n The increase of the Revenue has hitherto \n more than justified the expectations created by the \n receipts of former years. \n His Majesty recommends an early renewal of \n your inquiries into the operation of the Act per- \n mitting the establishment of Joint Stock Banks. \n The best security against the mismanagement of \n Banking affairs must ever be found in the capacity \n and integrity of those who are entrusted with the \n administration of them, and in the caution and the \n prudence of the public ; but no legislative regula- \n tion should be omitted which can increase and in- \n sure the stability of establishments upon which com- \n mercial credit so much depends. \n My Lords and Gentlemen, \n His Majesty has more especially commanded us \n to bring under your notice the state of Ireland, and \n the wisdom of adopting all such measures as may \n improve the condition of that part of the United \n Kingdom. \n His Majesty recommends to your early \n consideration the present constitution of the Muni- \n cipal Corporations of that country, the laws which \n regulate the collection of Tithes, and the difficult \n but pressing question of establishing some legal \n provision for the Poor, guarded by prudent regu- \n lations, and by such precautions against abuse, as \n your experience and knowledge of the subject enable \n you to suggest. \n His Majesty commits these great interests into \n your hands, in the confidence that you will be able \n to frame Laws in accordance with the wishes of His \n Majesty, and the expectations of His people. \n His \n Majesty is persuaded, that should this hope be \n fulfilled, you will not only contribute to the welfare \n of Ireland, but strengthen the Law and Constitution \n of these Realms, by securing their benefits to all \n classes of His Majesty's subjects. \n Resolved, That an humble Address be presented Resolution for \n to His Majesty, to offer our humble Thanks for \n Address. \n the gracious Speech which His Majesty has directed \n to be delivered by the Lords Commissioners. \n To express our satisfaction at learning that His \n Majesty continues to receive from all Foreign Pow- \n ers the strongest assurances of their friendly dispo- \n sition,|Order

but His Majesty has con- \n tinued to afford to the Queen of Spain that aid \n which, by the Treaty of Quadruple Alliance of \n 1834, His Majesty engaged to give, if it should \n become necessary ; and His Majesty rejoices that \n A. 1837. \n His co-operating force has rendered useful assistance \n to the troops of her Catholic Majesty. \n Events have happened in Portugal, which for a \n time threatened to disturb the internal peace of that \n country. \n His Majesty ordered, in consequence, a \n temporary augmentation of His Naval force in the \n Tagus, for the more effectual protection of the per- \n sons and property of His subjects resident in Lis- \n bon; and the Admiral commanding His Majesty's \n squadron was authorized, in case of need, to afford \n protection to the person of the Queen of Portugal, \n without, however, interfering in those constitutional \n questions which divided the conflicting parties. \n His Majesty has directed the Reports of the Com- \n missioners appointed to inquire into the state of the \n Province of Lower Canada to be laid before you, \n and has ordered us to call your attention to that \n important subject. \n We have it also in charge to recommend for your \n serious deliberation those provisions which will be \n submitted to you for the improvement of the Law, \n and of the administration of Justice ; assuring you \n that His Majesty's anxiety for the accomplishment \n of these objects remains undiminished. \n We are enjoined to convey to you His Majesty's \n desire that you should consult upon such further \n measures as may give increased stability to the Esta- \n blished Church, and promote concord and good- \n will. \n Gentlemen of the House of Commons, \n The Estimates of the year have been prepared \n with every desire to meet the exigencies of the Public \n Service in the spirit of a wise economy. \n His Ma- \n j esty has directed them to be laid before you without \n delay. \n The increase of the Revenue has hitherto \n more than justified the expectations created by the \n receipts of former years. \n His Majesty recommends an early renewal of \n your inquiries into the operation of the Act per- \n mitting the establishment of Joint Stock Banks. \n The best security against the mismanagement of \n Banking affairs must ever be found in the capacity \n and integrity of those who are entrusted with the \n administration of them, and in the caution and the \n prudence of the public ; but no legislative regula- \n tion should be omitted which can increase and in- \n sure the stability of establishments upon which com- \n mercial credit so much depends. \n My Lords and Gentlemen, \n His Majesty has more especially commanded us \n to bring under your notice the state of Ireland, and \n the wisdom of adopting all such measures as may \n improve the condition of that part of the United \n Kingdom. \n His Majesty recommends to your early \n consideration the present constitution of the Muni- \n cipal Corporations of that country, the laws which \n regulate the collection of Tithes, and the difficult \n but pressing question of establishing some legal \n provision for the Poor, guarded by prudent regu- \n lations, and by such precautions against abuse, as \n your experience and knowledge of the subject enable \n you to suggest. \n His Majesty commits these great interests into \n your hands, in the confidence that you will be able \n to frame Laws in accordance with the wishes of His \n Majesty, and the expectations of His people. \n His \n Majesty is persuaded, that should this hope be \n fulfilled, you will not only contribute to the welfare \n of Ireland, but strengthen the Law and Constitution \n of these Realms, by securing their benefits to all \n classes of His Majesty's subjects. \n Resolved, That an humble Address be presented Resolution for \n to His Majesty, to offer our humble Thanks for \n Address. \n the gracious Speech which His Majesty has directed \n to be delivered by the Lords Commissioners. \n To express our satisfaction at learning that His \n Majesty continues to receive from all Foreign Pow- \n ers the strongest assurances of their friendly dispo- \n sition,|Order
